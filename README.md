## Problem
In today's data-driven world, businesses and individuals are constantly dealing with large amounts of documents in various formats (PDFs, CSVs, Excel, JSON). Extracting meaningful insights or answering specific questions from these documents can be a time-consuming and challenging task, especially without a smart AI assistant.

The problem lies in:
- How to quickly extract relevant information from vast amounts of data spread across different document formats.
- Providing a seamless, intuitive way to query documents and get precise answers.
- Enabling efficient document-based question answering without relying on manual document review.
